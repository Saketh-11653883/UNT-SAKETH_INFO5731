The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us.\",\n          \"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential.\",\n          \"As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park.\"\n        ],\n

wears really thin and a Valkyries wannabe This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role Here he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himselfIts a real shame really a shame but hey the MCU has has the Taika touch and we all now he really isnt that goodI have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5And 6 and 7This will go on foreverHelp us\",\n          \"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse The hype surrounding AntMan and the Wasp 2 seemed impossible to meet The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation Unfortunately QuantumMania suffers the same fate Kang is intimidating powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered Majors is fantastic as the character and I cant wait to see him develop this character and other variants further However I cant help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature filmIts not all bad though On the contrary The film is often times charming engaging and genuinely funny It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late Our main cast of characters are solid though I cant help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential\",\n          \"As a huge fan of the first one and almost as big a fan of the second one I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats What a let down sure sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual motion and sensory experience was great but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story instead of any type of story that is part or compliments the MCU timeline This was literally one of Marvels dullest and most unnecessary movies to date The entire story was cliched and predictable and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story let alone one with any substance Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story so there was no need for any movie sets or locations this was all greenscreen nonsense Its a very generous 610 from me only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats although the money spent wouldve been more fun at an amusement park\"\n

Disney are now jumping the shark 31 films into the universe......Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us.\",\n          \"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here.

This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense.

Disney are now jumping the shark 31 films into the universe......Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us.\",\n          \"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential.\",\n          \"As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense.

Disney are now jumping the shark 31 films into the universe......Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us.\",\n          \"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential.\",\n          \"As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense.

Disney are now jumping the shark 31 films into the universe......Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us.\",\n          \"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential.\",\n          \"As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park.\"\n        ],\n

Disney are now jumping the shark 31 films into the universe......Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and The Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet and Hank Pym, and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang, the family finds themselves exploring the pretty redundant Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new CGI creatures, and monstrosities, and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of boredom, and what they thought possible.I love Ant-Man. The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us.\",\n          \"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential.\",\n          \"As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense.

The first two films were so so different to anything that Marvel had released, and Paul Rudd was amazing as the titular hero. It has humour that no other Marvel humour had, it was childish, and it was all the better for it. It dared to be different, and the payoff was something fresh, even when the marvel behemoth was becoming a little tired, especially after the debacle that was Age Of Ultron. If Wright wasn't given the cold shoulder, we could be watching something different, and while i don't think the blame should be placed on Reed's shoulders, the studio had the final say, it just doesn't have the panache that the first film had.It's boring, and dull, and the effects all meld into one after a while. It's like the makers have taken the cantina scene from A New Hope, and decided to make a whole movie surrounding it, adding a supposed bigger adversary than Thaos. Kang is not that villain. Majors seems to be homing his most campest bone in his body, as there is nothing remotely sinister about his character, he just tells people to shut up, and make their costumes slightly tighter. Add a worthless cameo from Murray, and what on earth did they do with M. O. D. O. K? And you have a Marvel film that lays in the bowels on the MCU along with Eternals, Love and Thunder, and The Dark World.Douglas and Pfeiffer are unforgivably wasted in this, Douglas there because of something that happens at the end with the ants, and Pfeieffer just there to tell the story of Kang. Little support is offered, aside from a guy who can read minds who's one running joke wears really thin, and a Valkyries wannabe. This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed, because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role. Here, he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himself.It's a real shame, really a shame, but hey, the MCU has has the Taika touch, and we all now he really isn't that good.I have really low expectations now for the rest of phase 5.And 6, and 7.This will go on forever.......Help us.\",\n          \"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror.

The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further.

The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late.

The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance.

running joke wears really thin and a Valkyries wannabe This was the franchise in the MCU that i wanted to succeed because Rudd is just so brilliant and funny in his role Here he is just a one dimensional hero who multiplies to become even more unfunny versions of himselfIts a real shame really a shame but hey the MCU has has the Taika touch and we all now he really isnt that goodI have really low expectations now for the rest of phase And  and This will go on foreverHelp us\",\n          \"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse The hype surrounding AntMan and the Wasp  seemed impossible to meet The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation Unfortunately QuantumMania suffers the same fate Kang is intimidating powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered Majors is fantastic as the character and I cant wait to see him develop this character and other variants further However I cant help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season  rather than a feature filmIts not all bad though On the contrary The film is often times charming engaging and genuinely funny It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late Our main cast of characters are solid though I cant help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential\",\n          \"As a huge

one of Marvels dullest and most unnecessary movies to date The entire story was cliched and predictable and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story let alone one with any

Constituency parsing represents these relationships as a tree structure.Dependency parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a phrase, where one word is dependent on another. For example, \"best mediocre\" demonstrates a reliance connection, with \"mediocre\" relying on \"best.\" The dependencies form a tree structure that depicts the syntactic relationships between words in the phrase."
